1.Divide&Conquer
  python divide_conquer.py 
  ouput will be in output_divide_conquer
2.dynamic_program
  python dynamic_program.py 
  output will be in output_dynamic_program

I check they work in ubuntu. But if they don't work in your computer, you can operate them on window system
Just open files (divide_conquer.py and dynamic_program.py) and click F5
